# Requirements for React Assignment 1

1. Create a new react app
2. Create and input and a button
3. Accept input and append to a list (You can use class based or functional components and you have to main in-component state to persisting the data). Make sure that this list auto-scrolls to this newly added element
4. expand each entry on click to display "entryname - expanded"
5. by default expand the latest entry in list
6. now create some predefined json data (since you will not be using any api to fetch data, you can hardcode this data into your app)
7. load this predefined data into the list (initial 20 records only)
8. scroll the list to the top, more data should load (say next 10 records)
9. Achieve infinite reverse-scrolling (similar to how messages load up in whatsapp chat when you scroll up).
